- I recently came across the article mentioned above, and decided that I was going to create this app! This is the first commit. 
- I will try to work on this application everyday. I've given myself a deadline of 2 months ( till 10th November 2021 ) to finish this application.
- I hope that along the way I will learn a lot about rails and ruby, and that by the end of these two months, i will have become an intermediate rails programmer.

- Created app with postgres database. ( remember to run db:create before running the server!).
- Added a pages controller and initialized the root path.
- Added bootstrap and jquery. (the require_self and require_tree . lines were removed. This makes it possible for us to manage the order in which scss files are rendered.)
- Added responsive navigation bar.
